					I did a lot of changes on this website:
					<p>- I modified the website based on the feedback i got.</p>
					<p>
						- I modified the way shopping are made on the platform. Now one can
						add items to the cart, and the total are show accordingly. The only
						issue however here, which i sadly did not have enough time to fix,
						is the fact when you remove and item, it is not removed from the
						total.
					</p>
					<p>
						- I modified the mobile version as well, now you have a better menu
						for that.
					</p>
					<p>- I added a sub menu for the shopping nav.</p>
					<p>- I added a google maps through an API.</p>
					<p>
						- Reasons behind the changes was due to new learning, but as well
						because of the different feedback i recieved made sense. I just hope
						i couldnt finish it up with the removal of items, but sadly that is
						not the case. I hope however, to learn this through my feedback.
