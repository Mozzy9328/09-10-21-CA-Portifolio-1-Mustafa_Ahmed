					<p>
						- I made changes to this website because of what i learned in my
						project exam, but as well the feedback from the tutor.
					</p>
					<p>
						- I did changes on visit us, exhibition, and get involved. Specially
						with the last two pages I added slideshow, that way one can click
						through it. I though about adding that to the homepage, but never
						had the time to finish that, so i left it as it is.
					</p>
					<p>
						- I added links to the news section on the homepage, this way you
						can get to it better. I realized later, maybe it would make sense to
						have News on the nav section as well. But again due to time...
					</p>
					<p>
						- Yet again i realize how much changes i needed to do, and how
						disorganised my coding can be. There was a moment i wanted to start
						all over! But, i hope you can focus on the design for now, and
						understand that due to the time, i couldnt organize my code to its
						best.
